Hi, I'm Yaoning Yu, a researcher with a strong background in Applied Data Science (UChicago) and Mathematics (UW). My work focuses on leveraging LLM and machine learning for financial insights, market analysis and automation. With experience in LLM applications, underwriting automation, and stock market analytics, I enjoy building intelligent systems that drive real-world impact. 

Currently, I'm exploring opportunities to apply AI in finance, industry research, and decision intelligence. **Moreover, I'm looking for industry and research opportunities!** Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
