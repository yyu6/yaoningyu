Hi, I am a Master student in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago (UChicago). Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the University of Washington (UW). During my time at UW, I worked with [George Manucharyan](https://deep.ocean.washington.edu/) in topics of Ocean Dynamics, mainly responsible for utilizing ML strategies to solve unknown deep ocean velocity. Currently, I am a research associate under the supervision of [Dr. Haohan Wang](https://haohanwang.github.io/) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign [Dream Lab](https://dreamlabuiuc.github.io/), focusing on LLM-agent research and its applications.  

### Projects

- [TradingHero: Empowering Traders with AI Stock Analysis](https://github.com/yyu6/TradingHero) - An advanced stock market analysis tool designed to streamline trading processes, reduce information overload, and enhance decision-making for semi-professional retail traders ([Honorable Mentions](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/news/masters-in-applied-data-science-autumn-2024-capstone-showcase/)).
- [Awesome-LLM-Data_Scientists](https://github.com/WhileBug/Awesome-LLM-Data_Scientist) - Papers related to the Large Language Model(LLM)-based data scientists agents (including code agents which are highly related to data science). 
- CredAIble - An LLM-agent-powered software that automates file classification and recognition in the underwriting process(Private github repo due to confidentiality).
- Robustifying LVLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks – Design inverse perturbation strategies based on CLIP embeddings and attention map analysis to defend large vision-language models (LVLMs) against jailbreak attempts and improve alignment robustness.
- Prompt efficiency via token trimming and prompt optimization - Design a prompt-only framework, mainly on mathematical benchmarks, for efficient reasoning in LRMs to reduce overthinking, underthinking, and token usage while boosting performance.
- NYC Taxi demand prediction - A machine learning model that estimates taxi demand and travel time across different locations and time zones in NYC.

### Research Interest

My research interests lie in Machine Learning, LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Multimodal Large Language Models, and AI Security.

**I am actively seeking industry and research opportunities in LLM-agent development and other exciting AI-driven fields.** Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you're interested in collaborating! 🚀
